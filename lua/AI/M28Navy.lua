--aiBrian variables
refiPriorityPondRef = 'M28PriorityPondRef' --against aibrain, returns the pond ref (naval segment group) that we think is most important to that aibrain (only recorded for M27 brains)
reftiPondThreatToUs = 'M28PondThreatToUs' --against aiBrain, [x] is the pond ref (naval segment group), returns the 'mex value' of that pond when considering mexes within 40% of our base (mod distance).  Only recorded for ponds where we have identified a naval yard build location
reftiPondValueToUs = 'M28PondValueToUs' --against aiBrain, [x] is the pond ref (naval segment group), returns the expected value of the pond if we have naval control of it (so ignores distance reductions that are used to decide if we want to build navy there in the first place)
refbEnemyNavyPreventingBuildingNavy = 'M28PondEnemyNavyNearBuildLocation' --against aibrain, true if enemy has navy near to the build location
